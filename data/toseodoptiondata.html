        <h2>thinkorswim End of Day Option Data</h2>

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
            FREE end of day option data is hard to come by. 
            In a world where stock data is given out like candy, option data remains hidden 
            behind paywalls. 
            Before I started this project, I scoured the internet to see if anyone had already 
            compiled free option data. 
            While I did find some (they are listed at the bottom of the page under Alternative 
            Sources), I found that even the best sources were limited to recent times. 
            There was only one place that retail traders could get option data that stretched to 
            over 20 years ago: thinkorswim. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There was, however, one problem: data can only be exported one day at a time. 
            Going back to the internet, people on subreddits had come to the same conclusion: the 
            process was too slow, with some posts talking about how it took days to export one 
            ticker’s end of day option data. 
            Despite that, I attempted the process myself. 
            I tried reading network data, but from what I could tell, the data was encrypted 
            until it reached the thinkorswim application. 
            I only have a basic, conceptual idea of network security, so I did not find it 
            feasible to figure out how to perform a man-in-the-middle interception to easily 
            grab the data. 
            This left me with automating the download process through thinkorswim itself. 
            At a cursory glance, you would assume an auto clicker or a simple macro would be 
            enough to export the data. 
            This turned out not to be the case. 
            There are so many caveats and exceptions regarding thinkorswim’s interface that it 
            effectively acts as a deterrent against this sort of GUI automation. 
            Eventually, after several months, I created a proof of concept that was robust enough 
            to export data, which leads us to here.

        <h3>Broker Data Weakness</h3>
        <p>
            When talking about option data, a point comes up about the quality and thinkorswim 
            data is no exception. 
            For groups, such as hedge funds, looking at option data is related to seeking alpha. 
            They are attempting to use the data to enhance a model or build a new model to take 
            advantage of what they believe to be unrealized value. 
            But why is broker data considered low quality for this purpose? 
            Well data must be usable and representative of real-life circumstances. 
            End of day option data from brokers usually represent the final snapshot of the last 
            trades before the closing bell; however, data for modeling option prices may need to 
            be some time before the closing bell to represent real life liquidity and prices. 
            On top of that, brokers do not particularly care to capture the data itself as 
            accurately as possible. 
            You may have data that has not been properly adjusted, data that has missing trades, 
            data that may just be flat out inaccurate, or dirty and unprocessed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite all these weaknesses, I believe retail traders still deserve a chance to 
            glance over something before opening their wallets. 
            Even if it is not the best, at least they have an opportunity to peek before taking the next step. 
        </p>

        <h3>thinkorswim Specific Weaknesses</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                thinkorswim data seems one day behind.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Example 1, in META: 
                        If the stock closed at $28.19 [1] on May 30, 2012 then thinkorswim has 
                        that data in the May 31, 2012 csv file.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Example 2, in META:
                        The ticker change for META (FB to META) occurred before market open on 
                        June 9, 2022 is reflected in the June 10, 2022 csv file.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Stock splits are not applied retroactively. 
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Example 1, in NVDA:
                        They have had 4 stock splits since January 2, 2003 (2x, 1.5x, 4x, 10x) 
                        for a total of 120x split [2]. 
                        If cross referenced with Yahoo Finance, the data as of October 7, 2024, 
                        says the price at close on January 2, 2003  was $0.10 [3]. 
                        However looking at the csv file for January 3, 2003 (remember the 
                        problem about a day behind mentioned above), the price is listed as 
                        $12.31.
                        If you do 12.31 / 120 = $0.10258 ~ $0.10.
                        This matches Yahoo Finance’s data. 
                        Thus in 2003, the price really was $12.31, but with the splits 
                        retroactively applied to it, the price becomes $0.10.

                                GOOG was the original class A stock. 
                                In 2014, Google decided to do a special type of stock split that 
                                split the stock into GOOG and GOOGL. 
                                GOOG was changed to class C and GOOGL became the class A stock.
